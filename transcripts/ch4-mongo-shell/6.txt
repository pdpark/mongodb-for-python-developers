00:01 The shell is pretty nice and it's ubiquitous
00:03 and that you can run it anywhere, you ssh to and things like that,
00:07 so that really good, and this is more or less the tools
00:09 that MnongoDB ships, you could work on something else that's coming along
00:12 but there's a really great, better shell in my opinion
00:16 much, much better, I really love it, it's called Robomongo,
00:19 so we talked about Robomongo in the setup how we installed it and so on,
00:24 so let's see how it works and how it compares to the shell here.
00:28 So here it is, you can see it hanging out down there
00:31 and we click start, maybe it's empty let's go ahead and start from scratch,
00:35 so now if we open it up it's empty, let's create a connection,
00:38 I'll just call this local or whatever,
00:42 and it's going to default the local host 27017,
00:45 all this stuff turned off, things like that, and we'll just say save and connect
00:50 and now you can see, let's put these little more side by side,
00:53 you can see over here we have our bookstore or charge watcher and so on.
00:58 And now we have the benefit that we can open this up
01:02 we can look at the book, we could say explore the indexes
01:04 we could even go over and say edit this index and make changes,
01:08 make it unique, do some other things about sparseness and so on.
01:12 We'll talk more about that later.
01:15 Over here, we could say something like use bookstore and it switches there,
01:19 the equivalent over here would be something like right click and say open shell,
01:23 how interesting, so I know a lot of people prefer the command line interface
01:27 but what's really awesome about Robomongo is
01:31 you have the entire cli right here, so I could say something like
01:35 db.Book, notice the auto completion, book, publisher, user, auth, etc,
01:42 .what do you want to find, find and modify, find one,
01:44 let's find one where, what did we have before, we had something with the title
01:48 and let me go back and find the title we were using—
01:55 so here we can say title like this, and now if I run it, I get a result down here
02:03 and I can explore it, I can see the ratings and so on,
02:06 and this, you know if we run this over here,
02:08 I get I did the little projection, I could do that as well.
02:12 So I get this text version and I actually don't really love this too much,
02:15 so you can actually just switch it to the text version here as well,
02:18 and you get color coding, highlighting, all sorts of stuff.
02:22 You also get this version which is kind of a flat version, I never use this
02:27 but you can use it if you want.
02:29 What is really cool is I can come over here and say
02:31 I want to maybe edit this document,
02:36 if I come over and do a find, I think—
02:41 here I get three, now if I do a straight find, not a find one,
02:44 I can actually go and edit this, so if I wanted to change
02:46 the date that this was done on, so let's say 2011,
02:52 save, rerun this, this is one with so many ratings,
02:59 here, this is the one I changed, number 2, now it's 2011.
03:05 So of course I could run an update command,
03:08 but you can do all sorts of interesting sort of UI things
03:10 so I really really like using Robomongo,
03:12 because it's one hundred percent as capable as the shell
03:15 so for example, I could come over here, this is like just typing Mongo
03:19 you could create variables, I could say var page,
03:25 let's do something with a paging here, so I come and say this
03:27 now notice, this uses get collection and it doesn't use the .Book like this,
03:32 I think it does that because it gets better intellisense or auto completion,
03:36 not really sure, anyway, you can do it either way, they are equivalent.
03:41 Now, let's go over here and imagine we're going to do some paging,
03:45 so first of all, let's just select the titles
03:47 remember the thing I did with the projection, exactly the same thing here,
03:51 there we go, I forgot to rerun it, okay.
03:53 So rerun it, now we get just the titles,
03:56 there's "Classical Mythology", "Clara Callan" and "Decision in Normandy" and so on,
04:00 so suppose we want to do paging,
04:02 I'd basically want to show you that this is like a full Javascript shell
04:05 plus kind of an editor, so watch this,
04:07 so if I put some semi colons in here, I can type let's say var page size is three
04:12 var page num, like what number are we on, let's say were on page two,
04:17 than down here I could say ok, this is what I want to do,
04:20 and I could do skip and page to actually do the paging,
04:24 so I could say skip and we'll do what page num, minus one, times page size
04:30 that's how many we want to skip,
04:34 and then we want to limit it to page size like this
04:38 so now I should get, let's see, go back to the beginning,
04:41 three things per page, we're going to be on page two,
04:45 so it should be the Flu, the Mummies and the Kitchen God's Wife, and that's it.
04:52 Oh, by the way if you highlight something, it just runs that expression
04:56 which apparently evaluates the two, run the whole thing—
05:00 notice Flu, Mummies, Kitchen, so we can do this basically
05:03 as much as we want to type up here,
05:06 but it's also a little editor, I mean just in almost every way
05:08 this is better than the shell and I could even use this
05:13 to connect to my remote MongoDB server, using ssh tunneling,
05:16 again, we'll talk about those kinds of things
05:18 when we get to the deployment section
05:20 but for pretty much the rest of the course, we're going to be using Robomongo
05:24 because it's just better in every way in my opinion.
05:28 All right, and as you saw Robomongo installs
05:30 on Windows, Linux and MacOs, so it's all good.
