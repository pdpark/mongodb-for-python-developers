00:01 Before we put the wraps on this course
00:04 let's do a quick lightning review of each chapter that we've covered.
00:06 We're certainly not going to cover everything that we covered in the chapter,
00:09 this is just a really quick review, but maybe the main takeaway from each chapter.
00:13 So we began the course by talking about what is NoSql,
00:17 and I think there's a little bit of a misunderstanding
00:20 or maybe multiple definitions of what NoSql means
00:23 sometimes people say it's not only sql,
00:26 sometimes you people say it means that there's no sql, the language involved in this.
00:31 Well what we saw is looking at the history back in 2009,
00:34 this concept of NoSql came about by a meeting of people
00:39 working on horizontal scales type of databases,
00:42 like what trade-offs do they make against relational databases,
00:45 so that they are more easily horizontally scalable,
00:48 and basically cluster friendly databases.
00:50 That world it's not whether or not there's no sequel
00:53 or there is sequel in the language, it's really about the style of databases
00:57 and the trade-offs around how they work with that data.
