00:01 Let's review how we connected to our production server
00:03 from Python and Mongoengine, here's how we connected before,
00:07 we just said the alias is core and the name is dealership,
00:12 and that was it, we just let everything else be the default
00:15 and that worked fine when it was a wide open server on our local machine.
00:18 It didn't work so well for production,
00:23 so we saw that we actually added this function that
00:25 there is a whole bunch of different things here
00:28 so it takes the password, the port, the server, whether or not to use ssl,
00:31 the username, as well as the alias and db
00:34 and I kind of broke this into two different functions
00:37 that you can use for multiple connections in this example,
00:42 but you could jam it all into one like I did in the project.
00:45 So I created this dictionary and we set additional things
00:47 like the authentication source and mechanism
00:49 and to tell it to ignore the ssl certificate,
00:51 I put it in the dictionary so it's easy to print out
00:54 like in my log here is I am connecting to the database server
00:56 so you know which machine you're talking to,
00:59 how you're talking to it, what user you're talking as, things like that.
01:03 So if you want to just put all that data straight into register connection, fine,
01:06 you could do that but I find this to be valuable for sort of historical purposes,
01:10 so here's how we connected and in my real example I said
01:14 we're going to use the old version if you don't pass in
01:17 a user name of password, or other things,
01:19 but if you do then I'll switch to this more advanced version here.
