00:00 Let's go through the MongoDB security checklist.
00:03 Now, most of these come from MongoDB,
00:05 but also from me personally, from my experience running the server.
00:09 I've run professional commercial websites
00:12 using MongoDB for many years, 5 or 6 years
00:14 and we've never had any problems, but you have to follow the rules.
00:17 Some of the rules include things like limit network exposure,
00:20 so this is always a good idea for databases
00:23 or anything else that listens on the internet,
00:26 if something doesn't need to talk to it, don't allow it to have an open connection.
00:30 Enable access control, that means add users and require them to authenticate,
00:36 this should really be the default, if I were king of MongoDB,
00:41 and I'm not, but if I were a king of MongoDB,
00:43 I would make a decree, a new rule that says
00:46 MongoDB is not allowed to listen on anything other than local host,
00:50 unless it has access control enabled, period.
00:54 That's not the way it works right now though,
00:56 by default you can just say listen on 0000
00:59 and it will, even if that's wide open, so that can be problematic,
01:04 so we're going to change that,
01:07 encrypt the communication, so certainly what goes on the wire
01:09 should be ssl style encrypted,
01:12 but there is an option to encrypt the data at rest,
01:15 I think you have to get the enterprise version of MongoDB which is the paid version
01:20 this is not something I worry too much about
01:22 but if it's something that you were about,
01:24 you can encrypt the data at rest using the wire tiger engine.
01:27 You can audit system activity, this is easy enough
01:32 turn on what's called a caped collection and turn on auditing
01:36 so it will keep some standard amount
01:39 obviously set up logging, all those types of things.
01:42 Back up, obviously you want to back up your data
01:46 this is production data, so back up, back up, back up, back up,
01:49 set up some way to back up and we'll see that there's two options
01:52 we can run a tool called Mongo dump which will just take a complete backup
01:56 and for a certain size of data, that could be pretty large actually
02:00 but for certain size that works fine,
02:03 at some point if you truly are working
02:05 with tremendous amounts of data that doesn't work so well
02:07 so there's various ways to set up replicas
02:09 that are like delayed or right on time, things like this
02:13 but back up, back up, back up, an important thing to do.
02:16 So you can find all the details on how to do this here
02:20 at mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist
02:23 now you're welcome to go over there and check that out
02:25 and I encourage you to do so,
02:28 but we're going to go through each of the yellow steps here
02:30 we're not going to talk about auditing, but everything else pretty much
02:32 and encryption and rest, we're also not going to do that,
02:35 everything else we're going to do as part of this chapter.
