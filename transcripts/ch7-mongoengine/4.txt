00:01 Here we are in the github repository for the course,
00:03 now notice I put the PyMongo play around stuff that we did
00:06 into a folder called dir 5 PyMongo,
00:09 now, we're over into our MongoEngine section,
00:12 and there's actually two things here,
00:14 there's a service central starter and then there's a server central;
00:18 so a lot of times people like to follow along with the code examples
00:20 which I totally encourage, and this one is the way,
00:23 it when we saved in the repository exactly the way we're about to get started.
00:27 This one we're going to evolve throughout this demo
00:30 until it becomes sort of the final version,
00:32 so I want to open this in PyCharm, and I want to use a virtual environment to do that,
00:37 so there's a couple of cool tricks I could do to make a life as easy as possible,
00:40 so here I am in that service central place, and if I do an ls
00:47 even pin files you see there's nothing other than
00:49 this sort of starter Python ting we'll talk about in a minute.
00:51 So the first thing I want to do is I want to actually set up a virtual environment
00:55 with Python 3s venv, I'll do a dash copies , and I'm going to call .env,
01:00 and the name .env here is something that PyCharm will look for,
01:03 so if I open this in PyCharm, after doing this
01:06 it will actually automatically use this virtual environment,
01:09 so that's cool, that'll save me a few clicks.
01:12 Let's go over here and throw this in PyCharm,
01:16 now it's going to take it a second, it's sort of looking
01:19 through that virtual directory, let me add the source control.
01:26
01:28 So here's a really simple starter application that we're going to talk about
01:31 but first let's make sure that we have PyMongo installed.
01:34 So let's just do a quick list, and notice
01:37 we're already automatically using our virtual environment,
01:41 that's because it's top level the project, and it's named .env
01:45 so PyCharm said cool, we'll use that, I didn't have to do anything
01:48 that's why I did that first thing in the terminal before open in here.
01:50 So notice we have basically nothing,
01:53 probably worthwhile to upgrade setup tools,
01:59 some of the things that depends on C completion sometimes a little nicer,
02:04 if I have that set up, ok so now we can pip install MongoEngine
02:08 and you'll see that also it's going to install PyMongo,
02:11 depends on 2.7.1. or greater, and it's thinking about PyMongo,
02:15 thinking about MongoEngine, and then we'll be done.
02:19 Perfect, it also uses six for Python 2, Python 3 compatibility.
02:24 All right, so now we have our system all set up, we have PyMongo installed
02:29 and here let me just show you this super simple little app,
02:32 there's absolutely no MongoDB stuff going on,
02:34 so we have this main that is going to print this header,
02:37 very cool, you can see we're going to call our app service central
02:41 and it's going to do this user loop, and the user loop just says
02:46 here's some actions that you can do, you can add a car,
02:48 you can list cars and if you look at implementation,
02:52 all of these are entirely empty,
02:54 here is where the MongoDB stuff is going to be happening,
02:56 so let's go and run this, notice there's no run configuration over here
02:59 no green button to run, so I can right click on this and say run
03:03 and it runs and actually let's make this little higher,
03:07 notice that it's running with the Python out of our virtual environment, Python 3,
03:11 okay, and now here are little header and then here's our user loop,
03:15 it says you can add a car, cool to do add a car,
03:17 you can list the cars, you can find a car, you perform service,
03:21 right so we just basically have the structure in place
03:23 and we're going to use this for the rest of this demo,
03:27 and like I said, we're going to be building on this concept of what we create here.
