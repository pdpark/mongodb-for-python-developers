00:01 You might be wondering, hey who is this guy talking to me anyway?
00:03 Here I am, hi nice to meet you, my name is Michael,
00:05 you can find me on Twitter where I'm @mkennedy
00:08 and just a little bit of my background;
00:10 so I run the Talk Python To Me podcast
00:12 as well as I am the founder and I've written many of the courses
00:16 at Talk Python Training, for example this one.
00:19 And I'm even in the MongoDB Masters program
00:22 which is a group of about 30 people who are external advisers to MongoDB,
00:28 who work pretty closely with the teams there and give them feedback
00:33 on how MongoDB is working in the real world, in our environments.
00:36 So I hope to bundle up all of this experience and package it into this course,
00:41 and really give you some great take aways.
00:44 I'm so happy you joined my course,
00:46 I'm looking forward to teaching you a bunch of stuff— let's get started.
