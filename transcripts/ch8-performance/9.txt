00:01 Now if we're using MongoEngine,
00:03 we don't have to go to the shell and manually type all the indexes
00:05 we basically go to each individual top level document
00:08 so all the things that derive from mongoengine.document
00:11 not the embedded documents, and we go to the meta section
00:14 and we add an indexes, basically array
00:17 so here we want to have, you can see the blue stuff that's highlighted
00:20 we want an index on make, we want an index on service history
00:23 and within service history, remember these are service records showing on the bottom
00:27 we went an index the description and price.
00:30 So for index that we put 'make', that's straightforward
00:34 and then we have service_history.customer_rating
00:37 so service history is the field name
00:39 and then customer rating is the field name of service record
00:42 and for some reason I don't have it blue, it's that last one down there
00:45 but we also want this composite key
00:47 so service_history.price and service_history.description
00:50 we want to be able to find where both of those match
00:53 and we're going to do that up by having
00:56 a more complicated entry in the indexes bit here
00:58 this is going to be a dictionary where the fields are set
01:00 to be this array of strings and not just the flat string itself.
01:04 So once we add this, when we run our code,
01:07 it's actually going to first time we work with that document
01:10 ensure that all the indexes are there,
01:12 and remember that like hung up our application for just a little bit,
01:16 but the real benefit here is our app is always going to be in sync,
01:21 we don't have to go oh oops, I forgot to add the index,
01:24 that one particular index to say the staging server,
01:27 or when I push to production are there new indexes,
01:30 I got to go out on the database,
01:32 now you don't worry about that, you just push your code,
01:34 restart your web app or whatever kind of app it is,
01:36 and then as part of interacting with it,
01:38 it will make sure that those indexes are there.
01:41 If you don't want that pause to be there,
01:43 just go and create the indexes you know the thing is going to create
01:48 put them on the production server and then push the new version of code
01:50 and it will just go great, these indexes exist.
