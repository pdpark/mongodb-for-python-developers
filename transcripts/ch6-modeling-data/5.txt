00:01 Let's close out this chapter with a few more sources
00:03 you can get some patterns here;
00:05 so recently I had Rick Copeland who is in the MongoDB masters program
00:10 along with myself, and I had him on the podcast on episode 109
00:14 to talk about applied MongoDB design patterns.
00:18 So this concept of embedding and modeling
00:20 and data duplication and all these things,
00:23 certainly we talked about on the podcast, and he talks about in his book,
00:25 but he has a lot of really interesting use cases
00:28 and actually some performance trade-offs,
00:31 using some of the atomic update operators, one versus the other or not at all,
00:37 just to see how that might work out.
00:40 So he's got a bunch of use cases and you might flip through his book
00:43 once you really get into things and say does one of the patterns he talks about
00:47 really closely match what I'm doing— you might get a huge jumpstart
00:50 on modeling your data with actual performance numbers behind it.
00:54 So check out the podcast, it's free
00:56 and check out his book if you find it to be helpful.
00:59 And final thought on modeling with these document databases is
01:02 there is no perfect answer, it's always this tension of
01:06 I could model it this way and this part of my app gets better,
01:09 I could model it another way, and that part is not quite as good,
01:12 but another part becomes more flexible or becomes better,
01:14 so it's really about balancing the trade-offs, not right versus wrong.
